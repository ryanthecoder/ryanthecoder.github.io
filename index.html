        	<h2> Integrating multiple home manufacturing devices to form more increase complexity of automated construction </h2>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Three dimensional printers have taken off in the past three years, and home models are now able to make intricate and 
			interesting designs. As professional- and consumer-grade versions increase in popularity, extensibility will need to be
			addressed. This project explores new technologies in 3D printing and is broken up into three phases: research, 
			machine engineering, and 3D GCode development.

			The 3D printer extension machine is based of the <a href="http://www.shapeoko.com/">Shapeoko machine</a> but features several 
			modifications the most important of which is replace the routing tool with a arm capable of holding several tools and extending them into the 
			3d printer. The development of this machine is ongoing and is tracked <a href="https://github.com/ryanthecoder/ryanthecoder.github.io/wiki/Hardware-design-homepage">here</a>. Development has begun with the Makerbot <a href="http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2">Replicator 2</a> but will include other
			3D printers in the future. Here is a demo of the two machines functioning together.
			<p>
			It is the hope of this project to have several tools available for the extension machine, but for the initial phase of development I will be using 
			an electromagnet to pick up and embed pieces into the 3D print at some part in the middle of a print. Embedding functional parts into the plastic of a 3D
			Print will greatly extend the ability of 3D printers and is fairly easy to implement.
