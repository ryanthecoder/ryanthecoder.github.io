        	<h2> Integrating multiple home manufacturing devices to form more increase complexity of automated construction </h2>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
			Three dimensional printers have taken off in the past three years, and home models are now able to make intricate and 
			interesting designs. As professional- and consumer-grade versions increase in popularity, extensibility will need to be
			addressed. This project explores new technologies in 3D printing and is broken up into three phases: research, 
			machine engineering, and 3D GCode development.  Initial research will include three dimensional machine tools 
			(3D printers, CNC routers, robotic arms etc.), GCode, 3D modeling software, and splicing software. To demonstrate
			the software I will need to create a device that interfaces with a 3D printer and embeds objects into an active print.
			I initially planned to use a robotic arm to perform this function; however, it may be cheaper and simpler to create 
			software by building my own 3D gantry crane. This would simplify the movements, rather than altering  a machine built
			to replicate an arm. The main focus of the project will be to write or make use of existing splicing software in order 
			to run both the embedding machine and the 3D printer off the same computer.
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
       	  This project will be a proof of concept design for integrating two automated machines. It will consist of interfacing a
		  <a href="http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html">replicator2 3D printer</a> with a derivative of the 
		  <a href="http://www.shapeoko.com/">Shapeoko machine</a>.

		  I have forked several open source software packages that I will adapt for this project. You are invited to follow me <a href="https://github.com/ryanthecoder">on my github</a>.
